## Features

- Uses the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) runtime to collect data from the [Phemex Exchange](https://phemex.com/) and save it to
  a [Minio](https://min.io/) [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket.

## Goals

- Build a batch process, which is considered to be a "offline distributed system" as opposed to a real time analytics pipeline.
- Attempt to map existing knowledge into a Rust application, consolidate skills and test Rust's readiness for this level of the stack.
- Avoid being too opinionated about where it will be deployed.
- Evolve to a state which it can be used to build out other ideas that I have.

## Structure

```
|-- Cargo.toml            <--- Where we can define our workspace configuration.
|-- client                <--- Logic for the app and tests to interface with infrastructure.
|   |-- Cargo.toml        <--- Where we can define client dependencies.
|   `-- src
|       `-- main.rs       <--- Binary containing the client logic.
|-- collector             <--- Logic for tests and the app to interface with infrastructure.
|   |-- Cargo.toml        <--- Where we can define collector dependencies.
|   `-- src
|       `-- main.rs       <--- Binary containing the collector logic.
|-- readme.md
|-- run-dynamodb.sh       <--- Bash script to run a local Dynamodb container.
|-- run-s3.sh             <--- Bash script to run a local Minio (S3) container.
```

## Development

In seperate processes/terminal window run the services that we will be developing against.

`$ bash run-s3.sh`

`$ bash run-dynamodb.sh` <----------------- todo

Begin by interacting with these services using the code in `/client/src/main.rs`.

Run syntax checking on client code as we develop by using `cd collector && cargo watch -s 'cargo build'`

Run the client.

`$ cargo run --bin client`

Run the collector.
`$ cargo run --bin collector`

Install new packages using `cargo add`.

Format code using `cargo fmt`.
